# Tutorial 1 - CHEN MANXI

## Part I

### 1. Request two numbers from the user and print the multiplicaion of the numbers.

* **IPO Model:**
    * Input: number1, number2
    * Process: result = number1 * number2
    * Output: result
* **Pseudocode:**
START
  PRINT "Please enter the first number"
  GET number1

  PRINT "Please enter the second number"
  GET number2

  CALCULATE result = number1 * number2

  PRINT "The mutiplication of the numbers is: " + result
END

### 2. Determine if a number is greater than 50
* **IPO Model:**
    * Input: (None from user)
    * Process:
      1. Generate a random number, store it in a variable called randomNumber.
      2. Check if randomNumber is greater than 50.
    * Output: A message that states if the number is greater than 50 or not.
* **Pseudocode:**
START
  GENERATE randomNumber (betweeen 1 and 100)

  PRINT "The random number is: " + randomNumber

  IF randomNumber > 50 THEN
    PRINT "The number is greater than 50."
  ELSE
    PRINT "The number is not greater than 50 (less or equal to 50)."
  ENDIF
END

### 3. Print the pass/fail grade
* **IPO Model:**
    * Input: Number1
    * Process:Chenck if Number1 is greater than 40
    * Output: A message that states if the number is greater than 40 or not.
* **Pseudocode:**
START
  IF Number1 > 40 THEN
    PRINT "Pass."
  ELSE
    PRINT "Fail."
  ENDIF
END

### 4. Print results of dice game
* **IPO Model:**
    * Input: (None from user)
    * Process：
      1.Generate a random number (1-6) for Player 1 (player1Roll).
      2.Generate a random number (1-6) for Player 2 (player2Roll).
      3.Compare player1Roll with player2Roll to determine the winner.
    * Output: player1Roll, player2Roll, and a message declaring the winner or a draw.
* **Pseudocode:**
START
  GENERATE player1Roll (random integer 1-6)
  GENERATE player2Roll (random integer 1-6)

  PRINT "Player 1 rolled: " + player1Roll
  PRINT "Player 2 rolled: " + player2Roll

  IF player1Roll > player2Roll THEN
    PRINT "Player 1 wins!"
  ELSE IF player2Roll > player1Roll THEN
    PRINT "Player 2 wins!"
  ELSE
    PRINT "It's a draw!"
  ENDIF
END

### 5. Print the perimeter of a rectangle
* **IPO Model:**
    Input: length, width 
    Process: perimeter = (length + width) * 2 
    Output: perimeter
* **Pseudocode:**
START
  PRINT "Please enter the length of rectangle:"
  GET length

  PRINT "Please enter the width of rectangle:"
  GET width

  CALCULATE perimeter = (length + width) * 2

  PRINT "The perimeter of rectangle is: " + perimeter
END

### 6. Print the minimum number from 10 random numbers generated by computer.
* **IPO Model:**
    Input: (None from user)
    Process:
    1.Initialize a variable minNumber, and set it a very big initial value (e.g.1000).
    2.Loop 10 times.
    3.In the loop： a. Generate a  randomNumber. b. Compare randomNumber and minNumber. c. If randomNumber less, then fresh the value of minNumber.
    Output: minNumber (The minimum value after 10 loops)
* **Pseudocode:**
START
  SET minNumber = 1000
  
  LOOP 10 times:
    GENERATE randomNumber (e.g., 1-100)
    PRINT "The randomNumber is: " + randomNumber

    IF randomNumber < minNumber THEN
      SET minNumber = randomNumber
    ENDIF
  ENDLOOP

  PRINT "The minimum number among 10 numbers is: " + minNumber
END

### 7. Print the number of odd and even number from 10 random numbers (10 – 100).
* **IPO Model:**
    Input: (None from user)
    Process:
    1.Initialize two counters: oddCount = 0 and evenCount = 0.
    2.Loop 10 times.
    3.Inside the loop: a. Generate a random number randomNumber (between 10 and 100). b. Check if randomNumber is even or odd using the modulo (%) operator. c. If it's even, increment evenCount. d. If it's odd, increment oddCount.
    Output:oddCount, evenCount
* **Pseudocode:**
START
  SET oddCount = 0
  SET evenCount = 0

  LOOP 10 times:
    GENERATE randomNumber (between 10 and 100)
    PRINT "Generated random number: " + randomNumber

    // (randomNumber % 2) == 0 means "the remainder when divided by 2 is 0"
    IF (randomNumber % 2) == 0 THEN
      // This is an even number
      SET evenCount = evenCount + 1
    ELSE
      // This is an odd number
      SET oddCount = oddCount + 1
    ENDIF
  ENDLOOP

  PRINT "Total even numbers: " + evenCount
  PRINT "Total odd numbers: " + oddCount
END

### 8.Count the number of alphabet U and M from a sentence entered by user.
* **IPO Model:**
    Input: sentence (A string of text from the user)
    Process:
    1.Initialize counters: uCount = 0, mCount = 0.
    2.Loop through each character in the sentence.
    3.Inside the loop: a. Check if the character is 'U' or 'u'. If yes, increment uCount. b. Check if the character is 'M' or 'm'. If yes, increment mCount.
    Output: uCount, mCount
* **Pseudocode:**
START
  SET uCount = 0
  SET mCount = 0

  PRINT "Please enter a sentence:"
  GET sentence

  // Loop through every character in the input sentence
  FOR each character IN sentence:

    IF character == 'U' OR character == 'u' THEN
      SET uCount = uCount + 1
    ENDIF

    IF character == 'M' OR character == 'm' THEN
      SET mCount = mCount + 1
    ENDIF

  ENDFOR

  PRINT "The letter 'U' appeared: " + uCount + " times."
  PRINT "The letter 'M' appeared: " + mCount + " times."
END

### 9.Display the frequency of a keyword from a web page.
* **IPO Model:**
    Input: webPageURL, keyword
    Process:
    1.Fetch the full text content (webPageContent) from the webPageURL.
    2.Search through webPageContent and count how many times the keyword appears.
    Output: frequencyCount (The total count)
* **Pseudocode:**
START
  PRINT "Please enter the web page URL:"
  GET webPageURL

  PRINT "Please enter the keyword to search for:"
  GET keyword

  // In real programming, this involves complex steps
  FETCH webPageContent FROM webPageURL

  CALCULATE frequencyCount = (count of 'keyword' occurrences in 'webPageContent')

  PRINT "The keyword '" + keyword + "' appeared " + frequencyCount + " times on the page."
END

### 10. Display the number of female student from a random list of 100 students.
* **IPO Model:**
    Input: (None from user)
    Process:
    1.Initialize counter femaleCount = 0.
    2.Loop 100 times.
    3.Inside the loop: a. Generate a random "gender" (e.g., 0 for Male, 1 for Female). b. If the generated gender is 1 (Female), increment femaleCount.
    Output: femaleCount
* **Pseudocode:**
START
  SET femaleCount = 0

  LOOP 100 times:
    // We assume 0 represents Male, 1 represents Female
    GENERATE randomGender (as 0 or 1)

    IF randomGender == 1 THEN
      SET femaleCount = femaleCount + 1
    ENDIF

  ENDLOOP

  PRINT "Out of 100 random students, " + femaleCount + " are female."
END

### 11. Display a list of 5 random numbers in descending order.
* **IPO Model:**
    Input: (None from user)
    Process:
    1.Create an empty list called numberList.
    2.Loop 5 times: Generate a random number and add it to numberList.
    3.Apply a sorting algorithm to numberList to arrange it in descending order.
    Output: The sorted numberList.
* **Pseudocode:**
START
  CREATE empty list called numberList

  LOOP 5 times:
    GENERATE randomNumber
    ADD randomNumber TO numberList
  ENDLOOP

  PRINT "Original list: " + numberList

  // In real programming, this is usually a single function call
  SORT numberList in descending order

  PRINT "Sorted list: " + numberList
END

### 12. Guess a random number generated by computer.
* **IPO Model:**
    Input: userGuess (repeatedly from the user)
    Process:
    1.Generate a secretNumber (e.g., between 1 and 100).
    2.Start a loop that continues as long as the guess is incorrect.
    3.Inside the loop: a. Get userGuess from the user. b. Compare userGuess to secretNumber. c. If userGuess is correct, print "Correct" and exit the loop. d. If userGuess is too low, print "Too low". e. If userGuess is too high, print "Too high".
    Output: Hint messages ("Too low", "Too high", "Correct!")
* **Pseudocode:**
START
  GENERATE secretNumber (between 1 and 100)
  SET hasGuessedCorrectly = false

  // This is a WHILE loop. It will keep looping as long as 'hasGuessedCorrectly' is false.
  WHILE hasGuessedCorrectly == false:
    PRINT "Enter your guess (1-100):"
    GET userGuess

    IF userGuess == secretNumber THEN
      PRINT "Congratulations, you guessed it! The secret number was " + secretNumber
      SET hasGuessedCorrectly = true  // This will stop the loop

    ELSE IF userGuess < secretNumber THEN
      PRINT "Too low! Try again."

    ELSE
      PRINT "Too high! Try again."
    ENDIF

  ENDWHILE
